Hello! My name is Carlos Hernandez, I'm from El Salvador, and currently, I live in Guatemala. 

I am studying systems engineering at Mariano Galvez University in Guatemala.

I know a bit of C++, and at university, I am currently learning Java. However, I want to learn Python and SQL for data science and data visualization purposes.
